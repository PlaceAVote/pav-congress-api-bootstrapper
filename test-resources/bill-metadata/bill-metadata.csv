Crime,s2514,114,Are Early Release Prisoners More Susceptible to Crime?,"This bill would require the Bureau of Justice Statistics to report on early release prisoners who relapse into criminal behavior.
In response to the revised Federal sentencing guidelines enacted in 2007, 2010, and most recently 2014 that enabled non-violent prisoners (including repeat drug offenders) eligible for early release, this bill would affect sentencing reductions passed by Congress. ","Address consequences of reducing prison sentencing with regard to the safety of the community and threats of criminal activity, while imposing further restrictions on mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines. ",Issue stricter guidelines issued by the Sentencing Commission for future prisoners eligible for early release under The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.,We have a right to know if reducing prisoners' sentences and releasing them early is doing more harm than good to our community. This report will show if and how many prisoners are being released early only to recommit crimes again and will help determine if reducing sentences is beneficial or dangerous to the community. ,"The main purpose of this bill is to stall and eventually diminish reduced sentencing for non-violent prisoners, not protect our community. These prisoners have committed Federal crimes and are not a danger to our community. Instead of reporting on recidivism, we should be researching and finding ways to help former convicts re-enter society by assiting with job training and placements. Prisons are overcrowded and need room for criminals who are actual threats to the community, such as sex offenders and murderers.",https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s2514,"https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwi5g8KPia_LAhULwWMKHYXeBKEQjBwIBA&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffarm5.staticflickr.com%2F4101%2F4754231502_38d6ee363a_o_d.jpg&bvm=bv.116274245,d.cGc&psig=AFQjCNEKXFQUNLujqr9kWpt2q_NYVu9Ogw&ust=1457455903338524"
Crime,hres467,114,Will Investigating and Reporting on Gun Violence Help Reduce Crime?,"This bill would establish a Select Committee of the House consisting of six Republicans and six Democrats to investigate on gun violence and report on recommendations and resolutions, including legislative proposals that would increase safety and preventative measures against gun-related criminal activity.  
Investigations would include causes of mass shootings, methods to improve the background checks on firearm purchasers, closing loopholes that allow some domestic abusers continued access to firearms, and strengthening penalties for gun trafficking and illegal purchasing. ",Supports research and data collection of gun violence.,Puts more restrictions on law abiding-gun owners.,The number of shootings and gun-related crimes is increasing and becoming a bigger threat in our country. There is strong need to find out how and why these crimes are being committed and ways we can prevent them.,"This is just another attempt to repeal the Second Amendment. Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Instead of spending unecessary time and money trying to repeal my right to bear arms, focus on harsher sentencing for prisoners as they're the ones responsible violent crimes, not guns.",https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hres467,Image already found/used
Crime,hr3713,114,Should Non-Violent Criminals Recieve a Reduced Sentence?,"This bill would reduce mandatory minimum sentencing and allow early release for certain non-violent drug defendants with limited criminal history (includes repeat drug offenders). 

Affects prisoners sentenced under the “three strikes” law by reducing their life sentence to a mandatory minimum of 25 years, and would reduce sentencing for inmates convicted and sentenced before 2011 for crack possession. ","Aims to to resolve the problem of prison overcrowding.
Allow prisoners to become eligible for early release by completing rehabilitative programs.",Doesn't address how a percentage of non-violent offenders actually did commit violent crimes but were able to negotiate a lesser charge in exchange for pleading guilty.,"How is that you can commit rape and murder and have the possibility of parole yet a drug conviction can mean a life sentence? Non-violent crimes are receiving harsher sentencing than violent crimes, which is leading to an increase of inmates and overcrowding of prisons.","Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Our country has a huge drug problem and unless we impose and maintain harsher sentencing guidelines, drug dealers and offenders will only continue contributing to the drug epidemic.

Drugs,s524,114,Do We Need to Improve Our Response to Opioid Abuse?,"This bill states the abuse of prescription drugs, opioid pain relievers, and heroin falls under addiction and substance abuse, not criminal activity. 

It would shift resources towards identifying and treating incarcerated people who are suffering from addiction, improve prescription drug monitoring programs to help avoid individuals from obtaining and abusing prescription medicine, and expand the availability of naloxone (can counter the effects of a heroin or opioid overdose) to law enforcement agencies and first responders. ","Establishes tighter restrictions on pain medication and similiar drugs, encouraging public education campaigns for opioid abuse and overdose prevention.

Acknowledges and treats drug use as an addition and not a crime, proposing recovery treatment programs as an alternative to incarceration.

Expands treatment for expectant and postpartum women struggling with addiction.","Establishes opioid and heroin addiction as a federal issue rather than state-to-state.

Limits opioid access to patients who are in geuine need of it.","Addiction is a serious epidemic in our country and with more accessibility to prescription medication, drug overdoses are becoming more common. There is a need for better pain management practices and education to those being prescribed pain medication (especially with regard to opioid) and preventative measures against individuals trying to abuse the system and obtain prescription medication/opioid for addiction purposes. Furthermore, this is an addiction issue, not criminal and a person is better off being sent to rehab as opposed to prison.","This should not be a federal issue but rather left to the state as not every state is dealing with prescription drug, opioid, and heroin abuse to the extent that others may. When it comes to the federal government, I would prefer my taxpayer dollars be used to address country-wide issues and not state-to-state.",https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s524,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Temazepam_10mg_tablets-1.jpg
Drugs,s2504,114,Should Marijuana Businesses Be Allowed to Advertise in the Newspaper?,This bill would end the U.S. Postal Service's ban on marijuana print advertisements (including ads in newspapers) and allow them in states where marijuana is legal. ,"Allow news publications to accept advertising from legal marijuana businesses in states where marijuana is legal. 

Increases ad revenue for news publications in addition to supporting legal marijuana dispensaries by advertising their businesses. ",Bill only applies to states where marijuana has been legalized.,The current ban on marijuana advertising makes it difficult for legitimate marijuana businesses to operate. It's time for the federal governemnt to start updating its rules and reulgations in states where marijuana is now legal.,"This shouldn't be a federal issue but rather a state regulated matter.

","Our nation is already experiencing drug epidemic that includes prescription drugs and opioid abuse and this will only make it worse. Furthermore, by placing a tax on marijuana, buyers who don't want to pay more and sellers who can't afford or don't wish to comply with this new tax will only continue to buy/sell illegally.

","Does not protect against obtaining civilian's private phone records, electronic communications, or cloud data (if suspected as a terrorist threat).","You can't put a price tag on our country's safety and to fight against terrorism and foreign attacks, it's imperative our government's resources are of the highest caliber.","This bill does not outline nor would it release how all funds generated from this bill are dispersed amongst the agencies and how they were then used.

Economics,hr3054,114,Would Separating Commercial and Investment Banking Protect Our Money?,"This bill would reinstate and update the Glass Stegall Act of 1933 by separating separating insured, deposit-taking banks from Wall Street's investment banks, brokerage firms, market market makers, and hedge funds. Commercial banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would be prohibited from acting as or affiliating with investment banking. 

Optional content (to further explain reasoning behind bill): A commercial bank holds checking and savings accounts and provides loans for customers. These banks are often insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which provides a safety guarantee for customers of the insured bank called ""deposit insurance."" Investment banks, on the other hand, offer financial advice and facilitate the trade of financial assets. Currently banks can perform both commercial and investment activities, and this combination is believed by some to have been a cause of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. 
",Separates traditional banks from riskier financial services.,"Banks can take up to five years to implement this bill while regulatators can stall for an additional year, bringing the delay to a total of six years.",This separation will reduce risk of financial crises and the need for federal bailouts.,Reinstating the act won't instantly fix everything that's wrong with our financial system. Banking is inherently risky and establishing the Glass-Steagall Act did not prevent a financial crisis from happening nor did it's repeal cause the meltdown of 2008. Separating commercial and investment banking would only cause complications and added expenses.  ,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr3054,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Wall_Street_(5899300483).jpg
